It should also be remembered that, in addition to other possible harmful effects, alcohol in large quantities gives additional energy.

The carbohydrates that we get with breakfast are used immediately, and the body does not put them as fat. Breakfast should be saturated with slowly absorbed carbohydrates. Various cereals are good, especially whole grain cereals. Sandwiches are also suitable, and you can afford a small treat for breakfast.'
